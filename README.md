# Pokégotchi : SEI Project 4        

## Description:     

This is a MERN stack web application - _Pokégotchi_ - built as group of three ([Ashish](https://github.com/EHCarr) (Team Leader), [Dan](https://github.com/Emsley1d) and I) in a timescale of one week, using linked frontend and backend applications: a Node.js backend, with Express framework and an Atlas hosted MongoDB database, linked to a React-based frontend application. This was Project 4 - the 'capstone' project - completed as part of General Assembly London's Software Engineering Immersive course. We presented a deployed version to my Instructional Team and fellow SEI cohort on 26/08/22.            

<!-- TODO : screenshot here please -->

This web app is a crossover between Tamagotchi and Pokémon, where users can select a Pokémon and then look after them: for example by healing them if injured in battle, or feeding them if they are hungry after not being fed for a while. The frontend app makes use of React's Single Page Application capability, meaning that the UI can render and update without the need for navigating between pages.     

I focused primarily on the frontend of the application, creating and styling all components with the exception of `Pokedex.js` and `Choice.js`. This includes signup/sign in, `User` CRUD operations, the Pokégotchi card and overall main App UI/UX. I also worked on the backend `User` APIs as well as some further backend APIs and functionality.

- Lucidchart ERD        
- Figma wireframes      
- Postman API testing       

## Brief & Project aims:       
The brief for this project was to use our knowledge of React combined with all earlier learning to build a full stack (MERN) web application (comprising linked frontend and backend applications), either solo or as a group, within the timescale of one week. This was our 'capstone' project: our most advanced project to date and the culmnination of our learning from the previous 11 weeks.        

Technical requirements included:             
- Complete full planning for the project: Trello board, wireframes, an ERD.            
- Use professional-standard version control to manage contributions as a team.      
- Incorporate the technologies of the MERN-stack, using AJAX to communicate between the React frontend and Express backend.     
- Include a well-styled, interactive Single Page Application frontend.      
- Implement token-based authentication, include sign up, sign in and sign out.      
- Include authorisation by restricting CUD functionality to authenticated users.        

Guidelines around self-sufficiency included:        
- Use all resources available to solve the issue on your own before seeking assistance.     
- If you do seek assistance in Slack, explain the issue as clearly and detailed as you can, include screenshots when possible, and be prepared to explain what you've done to solve the issue on your own.      
       
The aim of this project was to bring together everything we had learned through the course, and apply it in a comparatively complex MERN app. The self-sufficiency guidance was of particular importance, simulating a learning environment which was closer to a profssional coding environment than we had seen before; this would push us harder to think on our own feet, relying on documentation, research and trial and error problem solving.

The requirement to use React would challenge and consolidate our understanding of the key concepts for using the React library, for example: the Component life cycle, Single Page Applications and the use of React Functional Components compared with React Class-based Components.            

## Key takeaways and learnings:       
My number one takeaway from this: React is tough. Number two though: React is powerful, sleek and fast; it is great fun to work with and rewarding when you get thing working. I'm glad we covered React as the last part of the course: I think if we had looked at it sooner I would have been put off, rather than emerging the other side feeling excited about the prospect of working with it again. I came out of this project a much better - and indeed much more confident - React developer than when I went in and I am so grateful that I opted to work primarily on the frontend, as it really changed my perception of working with React.        

I enjoyed this project tremendously from start to finish (yes - even when things were not working or just plain going wrong!). It represented the moment where I turned a corner not just in terms of React, but also in so many other aspects. CSS finally 'clicked' for me, communication between frontend and backend suddenly became so much clearer, APIs stopped being quite so mysterious. I loved going back to the Express framework again (it felt like an 'old friend' after 21 days of Python & Django). Most importantly, I learned to value error messages: they're nothing to get annoyed or down about, they're literally just there to tell you what went wrong - in short, they're there to help you!       

Our finished product is still rough around the edges and by no means where I'd wanted or hoped for it to be, but the journey getting there is the important thing. I'm still proud to show off the app, but prouder still to show off the code that I had written. Lastly, I'm glad that I took the opportunity to work with two great developers rather than working solo as I had initially intended: this project was a fantastic (albeit very intense!) way to finish off the course.
